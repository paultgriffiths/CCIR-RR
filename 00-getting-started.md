## Working practices
Your physical and mental health are crucial to your well being as a person. These should always take priority over your 1-1 Project.  As you will know, science research can be an emotional roller coaster, so you should take care to look after your mental health when things are tough.  

I also feel that satisfying work, and a healthy environment, are important factors in your mental health. I am very sympathetic to the fact that it's your summer so please feel free to work hard, but at your own pace.  For me, working hard means applying consistent, focused effort to your research in a serious, professional way. It does not mean putting in unreasonable, unsustainable hours, leading to unhappiness / burn-out.

Maintain a healthy sleep schedule.

Pursue interests and hobbies outside of your scientific work. These help relieve stress. They also benefit your research! Stepping away from your problem and letting your mind wander elsewhere is, counterintuitively, a great way to stimulate creative thought.

## What you can expect of me
-	To be supportive: to the best of my ability or connect you to the support you need.
-	Mentor: you in your path to becoming an independent scientist. I will help you ask questions, engage the scientific literature, and design scientific work.
-	Guide research: in both large-scale and small-scale ways. I will help you to ask yourself what you want to accomplish, to select a first project, and to guide short term progress toward those accomplishments.
-	Provide feedback: in a timely manner on your research work, research direction, written products, presentations, software design, data analysis, career goals, and anything else of relevance to our collaboration.
-	Where appropriate: help to define and support timelines toward completion of work. That is, unless you prefer a hands-off approach, I expect to help you to define your goals and hold **us** accountable for them on a timeline that is feasible but ambitious.
-	To give my best effort to make our weekly meetings, but maybe expect that for family reasons I may need to reschedule. I will aim to give you at least 72h notice.

## What you should expect of yourself
-	Have a plan: identify a research topic, identify research milestones and goals, plan your timeline toward progress. 
-	Be resourceful: make progress towards your independence as a researcher. You should actively explore the literature, seek out solutions to your challenges, study independently in order to fill gaps in your own knowledge, and take the initiative to try things out when you’re curious to see what happens.
-	To take the lead in solving your problems and identifying next steps, but to be realistic in your expectations.  Ask yourself if this is a problem that you know how to solve or if it's a whole new type of problem - these are often harder and more energy-sapping.  Don’t spend time not knowing what to do next if you are stuck – reach out to me.
-	Ask questions: in our regular talks, via Slack, and any time there is an opportunity. If you're stuck, ask yourself what google can tell you, refine the question you're trying to solve, look for other people's solutions, and reach out to me when still stuck. Understand that, 'Hey, I'm thinking about doing X to solve problem Y' is much easier to answer and give feedback on than 'Hi, Y is giving me problems'
-	To follow a schedule that works for you, focus on other things that take priority, and make sure you have a summer, and take breaks when you want to.
-	Decide on the number of hours that you have available to work, and use them. Try to be aware when you're engaged in a project and when not (time spent sitting at the computer maybe catching up with social media vs the time spent coding/reading). 
-	Give me warning - say 48h - if you need to reschedule the meetings.


## Keeping a record of research that you can share with me

* How you do this is up to you.  I recommend a Google Doc in 'pageless' format, or OneNote (more sections).

## Keeping a record of research that is just for you

* notes, ideas for next steps, papers read, interesting figures, copied bits of text, inspiration, weblinks
* research progress day by day
  * what did you set out to do?
  * what did you do?
  * was it successful?
  * what needs to be fixed
  * what needs to be done next
  * copies of figures made, links to where the idea came from

## Communication
We will use several channels of communication. You are expected to participate in all of them.

Slack is our preferred mode of communication within the group. It’s a way to discuss things more interactively and informally than email.

Github is where we store and discuss all things software-related. Everyone should have a github account.

Trello is where we manage tasks and keep an eye on progress - update it as often as you can.
